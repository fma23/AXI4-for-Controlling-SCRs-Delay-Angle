2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clock are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clock]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clock are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clock]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_1[0] relative to clock(s) clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_1[1] relative to clock(s) clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_1[2] relative to clock(s) clock 
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_1[4] relative to clock(s) clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED_1[5] relative to clock(s) clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
